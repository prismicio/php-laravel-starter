# Laravel starter

This is a blank [Laravel](https://laravel.com) project that will connect to any prismic.io repository. It uses the prismic.io PHP development kit, and provides a few helpers to integrate with a Laravel website.

## Getting started

### Launch the starter project

_(Assuming you've [installed Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/installation))_

Fork this repository, then clone your fork, and run this in your newly created directory:

```bash
composer install
```

Next you need to make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env` inside your project root.

Run the following command to generate your app key:

```
php artisan key:generate
```

Then start your server:

```
php artisan serve
```

Your Laravel starter project is now up and running!

### Configure the starter project

Edit the `config/prismic.php` prismic configuration file to get the application connected to the correct repository:

```
'url' => 'https://your-repo-name.prismic.io/api/v2',
```

You may have to restart your server.

### Create your routes and pages

When the project is first launched and viewed, it will by default display a help page. Here you will find some documentation to help you get started with your Laravel project.

It includes an example that shows how to create a route and query a document of the custom type "page". It then shows how to integrate the content into the Laravel templates.

Check it out to get a better understanding of how you would create your own routes and templates for your project. You can also explore our documentation to learn more about how to [query the API](./docs/02-query-the-api/01-how-to-query-the-api.md) and how to integrate content fields like [Rich Text](./docs/03-templating/14-rich-text-and-title.md), [Images](./docs/03-templating/09-images.md), and more.

## Deploying your Laravel application

Once you've created your website, an easy way to deploy your Laravel application is to use [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com). Just follow these few simple steps once you have successfully [signed up](https://id.heroku.com/signup/www-header) and [installed the Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/):

Create a new Heroku application

```
$ heroku create
```

Initialize a new Git repository:

```
$ git init
$ heroku git:remote -a your-heroku-app-name
```

Commit your code to the Git repository if you haven't already:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -am "make it better"
```

Set a Laravel encryption key:

```
$ heroku config:set APP_KEY=$(php artisan --no-ansi key:generate --show)
```

Push to Heroku:

```
$ git push heroku master
```

You can now browse your application online:

```
$ heroku open
```

You can read more about launching your project with Heroku here in their [Laravel & Heroku guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-laravel).
